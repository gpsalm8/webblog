                    <p>The customs and traditions of the Isnags are interwoven in their daily activities, festivities, and celebrations. The Isnags practice rituals and customs that correspond to every activity such as farming (<em>aga-alikam</em>), the death anniversary of a relative (<em>abobat</em>), marriage (<em>aggaatawa</em>) and feasting (<em>Say-am</em>). These practices have been modified through the years with the inculcation of Christianity, and with the influx of immigrants from other provinces who brought with them their own cultures.</p>

                    <p>Every year, Arya! Abra adopts theme that serves as the basis for all activities to be conducted. In order to promote the products of the province, all the towns participated in a trade fair, showcasing their own specialties. The festival included a Youth day with a parade and strret dancing, highlighted by a Mascot competition, International Women's Day celebration, an acrobatic show, and the championship game of the Congressional Cup.</p>
